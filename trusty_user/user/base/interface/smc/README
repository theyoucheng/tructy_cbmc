SMC service
===========

SMC service is a dumb pipe that routes Trusty userspace calls to SMC back and
forth. SMC service can be used to implement userspace drivers.

TIPC Interface
==============

SMC service provides userspace a simple synchronous protocol over TIPC:
- Service can only process one message at a time.
- Clients must process the response before sending another message.

Messages sent to and received from SMC service are represented by
struct smc_msg.

All necessary data structure(s) for both kernel and userspace are declared in:
- trusty/user/base/interface/smc/include/interface/smc/smc.h
